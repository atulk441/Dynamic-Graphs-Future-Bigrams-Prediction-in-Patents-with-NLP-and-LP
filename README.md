# Dynamic-Graphs-Future-Bigrams-Prediction-in-Patents-with-NLP-and-LP

## Abstract:
In this paper, we aim to predict future bigrams using Dynamic Graphs, LP, and NLP concepts. We’ll begin by discussing the background information about the problem 
statement. Then we will provide a detailed description of the datasets, followed by tasks performed under NLP. Once performed, we will focus on the graph construction, which will be used to perform the link prediction methods like calculating the similarity coefficients and how they will be fed to the ML models. Finally, we will analyze how effective each implemented model was to predict future bigrams by calculating several performance measures

## Results Highlights:
• All the models are performing well enough achieving an accuracy of 90% except the decision tree with a bit low accuracy. <br>
• None of the models are overfitting the training data, achieving almost the same accuracies on the test and training set. <br>
• The Voting Classifier achieved the highest accuracy on the training set, but XGBoost is considered to be the best-performing model due to the highest accuracy on the test set.
